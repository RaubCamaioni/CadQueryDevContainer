## CadQuery VScode Dev-Container

A basic vscode devcontainer with X11 GUI support.  
cq-editor can be run inside the docker container.  
cadquery and cq-editor use the same conda environment.  

Linux systems will need to edit the devcontainer.json to remove WSL2 references.  
The current settings will work on Windows systems with WSL2 installed.
